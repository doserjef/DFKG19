This directory contains the necessary files for running the multivariate models 
described in Doser et al (2019) Assessing soundscape disturbance through hierarchical models
and acoustic indices: a case study on a shelterwood logged northern Michigan forest. 

File Descriptions: 

computeDesignMatrix.R: computes the design matrix for the multivariate model
multivarSoundModel.R: Gibbs sampler for the multivariate model when run with real data
sim-main.R: parent file for assessing model when run with simulated data
main.R: parent file for assessing model output when run with real data
sim.R: parent file for simulating data for the multivariate model
theta-samples-*: posterior samples from the model runs used in the paper for three different chains
pfile-*: the parameters used in the three runs of the model with the real data.
sim-multivariateSoundModel.R: Gibbs sampler for simulated data in the multivariate model
