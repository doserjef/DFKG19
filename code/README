The 'code' directory contains code for data prep, organization, and models used in
Doser et al (2019): Assessing soundscape disturbance through hierarchical models
and acoustic indices: a case study on a shelterwood logged northern Michigan forest.

Files in the main directory were computed and used in the order of the numbers of the files

The specific code for running the two models described in the manuscript are found in 
the univariateModel and multivariateModel directories. 

The fiile soundscape.R contains two functions used in some of the main files.
